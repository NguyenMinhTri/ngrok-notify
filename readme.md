# ngrok-notify

Create ngrok tunnel to expose localhost to the web and notify by email with the ngrok URL

## Install

Linux, OS X, *BSD

```
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g ngrok-notify
```

We need to install with the `--unsafe-perm` flag to enable the underlying `ngrok` package to run its postinstall script as root to download and save the ngrok binary in the global `node_modules` folder.  This extra flag is not necessary for Windows installations.

Windows

```
C:\> npm install -g ngrok-notify
```

## Configure

Create a directory to store the configuration files and navigate to it:

```shell
$ mkdir ngrok && cd ngrok
```

Copy the starter configuration files into this directory:

```shell
$ ngrok-notify init
```

Modify your Gmail account (or create a separate Gmail account for sending messages) and [configure it for less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).  This is needed so the underlying npm module used by ngrok-notify for sending email (Nodemailer) can send email using Gmail.  See also the Nodemailer notes on [using Gmail](https://community.nodemailer.com/using-gmail/).

Update the following configuration files:

- `config.yml` - Add Gmail account to use for sending messages and email recipients
- `.env` - Add password for the Gmail account used to send messages

## Use it

Host a web server on port 8080 (or port of your choice) using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), etc.

Create an ngrok http tunnel to expose port 8080 running on the localhost to the world.

```shell
$ ngrok-notify http 8080
```

An ngrok tunnel on the public Internet will be created and the ngrok URL will be printed to the console.  Additionally, `ngrok-notify` will send you an email with the ngrok URL.

The email can be especially handy if you use ngrok-notify in conjunction with a process manager such as [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/).  After rebooting your system, you will receive an email with the new ngrok URL without needing to log into the system and start the tunnel manually.

## Usage

```
$ ngrok-notify --help

  Create ngrok tunnel to expose localhost to the web and notify with ngrok URL

  Usage: ngrok-notify PROTO PORT [-n]
         ngrok-notify init [-f]

  Positional arguments:
    PROTO           Protocol to use in the ngrok tunnel {http,tcp,tls}
    PORT            Port number of the localhost service to expose (e.g. 8080)
    init            Copy starter config files into directory for customizing
  Optional arguments:
    -n, --noemail   Do not send an email providing the URL of the ngrok tunnel
    -h, --help      Show help
    -v, --version   Display version information
    -f, --force     Overwrite config files in directory if they exist.
  Notes
    Email messages are sent using the settings in the config.yml file and the
    Gmail password stored in the .env file.

  Examples
    Create ngrok tunnel to expose localhost web server running on port 8080.
    Email is sent with the ngrok URL since "--noemail" is not included.
    $ ngrok-notify http 8080

    Create ngrok tunnel to expose localhost web server running on port 8080,
    but don't send email.
    $ ngrok-notify http 8080 -n
```

## Alternatives

This package leverages the excellent [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) package and provides notification capabilities.  If you don't have a need for the notify feature, you may want to consider using the [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) package directly instead.
